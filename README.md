### React + NextJs + TypeScript + Vercel + PortgreSQL

# [Visit the project in production](https://mypersonalresume.vercel.app/resumes/AndoniAT)

An application so that users can personalize their own resume.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is a modern web application developed with Next.js and deployed on Vercel, combining profile management, web page customization, and social features. It allows users to create and personalize their own responsive website, add interactive content (text, images, HTML, YouTube videos, etc.), and easily manage styling through a visual interface without coding.

The application features secure authentication with NextAuth, advanced role and permission management, and an image storage system using UploadThing. Each user can search for and follow other profiles, turning the application into an interactive social network.

With a smooth user experience, an intuitive interface, and a secure architecture, this project provides a complete solution for creating, customizing, and sharing online content.

## üîí Security & Authentication
  - Secure authentication with NextAuth, ensuring reliable session management.
  - Route protection based on user roles: access is restricted according to defined permissions.
  - Error handling with clear messages to inform the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Features
### Profile Management & Social Network
  - Each user has a personal profile, including an image gallery stored via UploadThing.
  - Ability to search for and follow other users, creating a social network dynamic.
  - Profile view, edit, and delete functionalities.

### üìÑ Responsive Web Page Editor
  - Each user can create and customize their own responsive web page with five screen types: 2XL, XL, LG, MD, and Mobile.
  - The profile serves as the default homepage, but multiple sections/pages can be added.
  - Available elements on a page:
    - Text
    - Images
    - Custom HTML content
    - iFrame (e.g., YouTube)
    - Each element can be visually customized through an intuitive interface, without the need to code in CSS.

### üîó Navigation & User Experience
  - Dynamic links to reference other elements or pages within the application.
  - Skeleton loading with Suspense to enhance fluidity and prevent waiting times during data loading.
  - Real-time error handling to guide users in case of issues with forms or data loading.

### üöÄ Deployment & Technologies
  - Front-end: Next.js (React)
  - Back-end: RESTful API with PostgreSQL
  - File Storage: UploadThing
  - Hosting: Vercel

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open App in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Database has been created with [vercel](./https://vercel.com), you have to create a new postgres database and fill your .env file corresponding with your db credentials in vercel.

Seeding database structure and some initial data test with command: `npm run seed`
Test code with lint: `npm run lint`
Build in production: `npm run build`


For the login, we need to generate a secret key for the application. This key is used to encrypt cookies, ensuring the security of user sessions. Run the following command : `openssl rand -base64 32`

Then, in .env file, add the generated key to the AUTH_SECRET variable:

`AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key`

NOTE : For auth to work in production, we'll need to update our environment variables in your Vercel project too.
